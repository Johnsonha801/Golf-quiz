# Golf-quiz

#Overview:
This project was built to quiz you on random golf related  questions. Once the quiz starts, a timer is started that counts down from 60 giving the user 60 seconds to complete the timed quiz. Each question they get incorrect will result in a deduction of 10 seconds from their current time remaining. If time runs out, the quiz ends and you get a zero. Points are an exact representation of how much time the user had remaining at the end of the quiz.
